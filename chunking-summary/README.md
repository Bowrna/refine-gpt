This python script for text summary(example: Book Summary)with summary of each text chunks sent. ( It can be based on chapter, section). To retain the information as whole, we can leave store the summary of each chunk which will have distilled summary of each chapter. 

If you still want to create summary of summaries, we can pass that to OpenAI again to get more crisp output.
