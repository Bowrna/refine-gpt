This is a python script for text summary(example: Book Summary) with summary data collected from overlapping chunks of text information. The multiple outputs received can be still passed through another layer of overlapping summary chunks until we reach the desired summary size. Still there is a possible leak of data and not an efficienct way of summarizing due to multiple API calls.
